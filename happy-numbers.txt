// Rosetta Code: Happy numbers
// A happy number is defined by the following process:

// Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.

// Implement a function that returns true if the number is happy, or false if not.
